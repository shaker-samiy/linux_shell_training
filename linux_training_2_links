#making a directory(exercies2) to practice your training:

mkdir exercies2

#change directory going into exercies2:

cd exercies2

#making 3 new files as orginal files:

touch original_file1 original_file2 original_file3

#check the link counk for these files:
ls -l original_file1 original_file2 original_file3

#creating a hard link pointing original_file1:

ln original_file1 hloriginal_file1

#checking the link count, permission fot original_file 1 and its hard link:

ls -l original_file1 hloriginal_file1

#creating a soft link pointing original_file2:

ln -s original_file2 sloriginal_file2

#checking the link count, permission fot original_file 2 and its hard link:

ls -l original_file2 sloriginal_file2

#creating a hard link pointing original_file3:

ln original_file3 hloriginal_file3

#creating a soft link pointing original_file3:

ln -s original_file3 hloriginal_file3

#checking the link count, permission fot original_file3 and their hard and soft links:
ls -l original_file3 hloriginal_file3 sloriginal_file3

#creating a soft link pointing the soft link of original_file3:

ln -s sloriginal_file3 slsloriginal_file3

#checking the link count, permission fot original_file3 and two soft links:

ls -l original_file3 sloriginal_file3 slsloriginal_file3

#creating a soft link pointing the hard link of original_file3:

ln -s hloriginal_file3 slhloriginal_file3

#checking the link count, permission fot original_file3 and  soft and links:

ls -l original_file3 hloriginal_file3 slhloriginal_file3

#removing the all types of links

rm hloriginal_file1 sloriginal_file2 hloriginal_file3 sloriginal_file3

more cases for upcomong work:
removing the link even or hard and try to acces the files
removing the hard link of file that have another soft link and try to acces it 
removing the soft link of file that have another hard link and try to acces it 
checking the size of links hard or soft

#clearing the training:
rmdir -i exercise2

#finishing the training
